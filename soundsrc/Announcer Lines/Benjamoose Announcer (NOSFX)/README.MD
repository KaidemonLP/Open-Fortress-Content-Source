#### Here's a list of things to do:
* Player destruction!
	* There's alot of recordings that sound like "layer destruction."
* Five frags left! (and so on)
	* There was alot of inconsistency with the frag lines. (either extra was added or something was missing.) there's also a time where it sounds like "flags"
* Now, let's have a fair fight... Go!
	* Because of the long pause between fight and go the sound got cut into seperate parts.
* Five frags left! (and so on)
	* A bunch of of the lines have extra dialoge and needs to be approved.
Etc.
