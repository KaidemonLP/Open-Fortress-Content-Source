hey this is iibo.

the latest version of stockyard/wiseau that was to ship with TF2C was dm_stockyard.vmf (date modified: january 5 2017). the file dm_stockyard_dev2 is the same thing just a different name.

there's a ton of other weird stuff in here, also some stuff i think that isn't related to wiseau but whatever

i also included the source files for the other map i was starting to make (dm_range) if that's of any interest

cheers
